                When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only, what would that wish be?” almost everyone; from beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to religious leaders, to children, to the average person on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary, are meaningless. As long as humans exist there will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history of humankind there has never been peace on earth. Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect.
